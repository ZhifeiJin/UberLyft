# Project description

Ride sharing has been one of the major commute options. For price sensitive users, the predicted price of each ride might influence their choice of ride sharing providers.
In this project, we explore the potential factors in the calculation of prices for rides offered by Uber and Lyft. We consider the influence of weather, distance, the day of the week and the hour of the day, and models of the vehicle on the price. We work on a dataset provided from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma), which contains almost 700,000 examples from ride sharing events in the area of Boston, MA in November and December, 2018.
